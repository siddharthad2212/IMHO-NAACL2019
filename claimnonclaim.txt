Well how can you expect young people who haven't experienced being old to make informed voting decisions regarding retirement? You could say that young people will vote in interests of creating the best retirements because they will some day retire but do you really expect people to prioritizes decades in the future over the short term?&gt; Should young adults with trust funds not be allowed to vote because they don't know what it is like to live pay check to pay check? What about terminally ill adults? They wont experience long term consequences. What about the unemployed? They don't pay income tax so they don't contribute (for the sake of argument).

What category can you imagine in which billions of people will be working in the future?&gt; It turns out that there is a final category. It is known as Unemployment. As Agriculture, Manufacturing, and Services become more efficient in the coming months, workers will have nowhere to go but to the unemployment line. At some point, Man's artificial economic system will necessarily collapse. When that happens, the corporations which produce and deliver food will no longer have an incentive to do so. The cities will suffer great hunger and it will be the end of Man.&gt; The current jobless situation you read about in the news is not an ordinary part of the business cycle.
